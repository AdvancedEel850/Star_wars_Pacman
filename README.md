# Game:

I will be re-creating the classsic game... Pac-Man!

# About the Game:

Pac-man is a game about a little circle that goes nom-nom-nom. The goal is to eat all of the pellets around the map. The pellets are the yellow dots around the screen. Throughout the game, 4 ghost are realesed from the center square that will try to eat pac-man. Once all the pellets are eaten, the level, or game, is over. Pac-man has three lives, and the ghost have infinte amount of lives. My version will not be the original game, but star-wars themed. Pac-man will be replaced by luke skywalker, the ghost by atat walkers, and the pellets by blasters. All images used were found on google, then modified to work better for the game.
